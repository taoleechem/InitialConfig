Result shows that this program works pretty good with one interesting problem.

In this test, I find the problem that in some configs, distance of  most closest atoms between 2 molecules is too short. This problem arises from my function frined Molecule::AdjustAtomDistanceMoveB(), where I just move the most closest atoms to distance 3.00, without considering the distance between other molecules while this adjustion.

I should change the MassCenter between these 2 molecules rather than some specific atoms.
